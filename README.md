# 🚉 The Commute – Mumbai Local Train System (DAA Project)

This project was developed during the 3rd semester under the subject **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**. It focuses on understanding and optimizing Mumbai's local train network using algorithmic thinking and C++ programming.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Mumbai has a land area of just 603.4 km² but serves a population of over 20 million. Its local train system forms the backbone of daily transport for millions. However, issues like uneven crowd distribution, inefficient transfers, and delays still persist.

We analyzed how the city manages such high transport demand and explored algorithmic solutions to improve the system.

## 💡 Objectives

- Understand the structure and working of Mumbai's local train system
- Model train routes, stations, and commutes using graphs
- Apply DAA concepts (e.g., shortest path, BFS/DFS) in C++
- Propose optimizations for commute experience and efficiency

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Graph representation of station network
- Shortest path algorithms (like Dijkstra’s)
- BFS for route discovery
- Station-to-station transfer cost modeling

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: Graph theory, DAA principles
- **Report**: Designed using LaTeX/Word and includes map, analysis, and CST study
